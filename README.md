## Installation Node / Bun / Deno

```sh
npm i fuzzysort
```
```js
import fuzzysort from 'fuzzysort'
```
```js
const fuzzysort = require('fuzzysort')
```



## Installation Browser

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/fuzzysort@3.0.2/fuzzysort.min.js"></script>
```


## Usage

### `fuzzysort.go(search, targets, options=null)`

```js
const mystuff = [{file: 'Apple.cpp'}, {file: 'Banana.cpp'}]
const results = fuzzysort.go('a', mystuff, {key: 'file'})
// [{score: 0.81, obj: {file: 'Apple.cpp'}}, {score: 0.59, obj: {file: 'Banana.cpp'}}]
```

### Options

```js
fuzzysort.go(search, targets, {
  threshold: 0,    // Don't return matches worse than this
  limit: 0,        // Don't return more results than this
  all: false,      // If true, returns all results for an empty search

  key: null,       // For when targets are objects (see its example usage)
  keys: null,      // For when targets are objects (see its example usage)
  scoreFn: null,   // For use with `keys` (see its example usage)
})
```




## What's a `result`

```js
const result = fuzzysort.single('query', 'some string that contains my query.')
result.score       // .80 (1 is a perfect match. 0.5 is a good match. 0 is no match.)
result.target      // 'some string that contains my query.'
result.obj         // reference to your original obj when using options.key
result.indexes     // [29, 30, 31, 32, 33]

result.highlight('<b>', '</b>')
// 'some string that contains my <b>query</b>.'

result.highlight((m, i) => <react key={i}>{m}</react>)
// ['some string that contains my ', <react key=0>query</react>, '.']
```

### Advanced Usage

Search a list of objects, by multiple complex keys, with custom weights.

```js
let objects = [{
  title: 'Liechi Berry',
  meta: {desc: 'Raises Attack when HP is low.'},
  tags: ['berries', 'items'],
  bookmarked: true,
}, {
  title: 'Petaya Berry',
  meta: {desc: 'Raises Special Attack when HP is low.'},
}]

let results = fuzzysort.go('attack berry', objects, {
  keys: ['title', 'meta.desc', obj => obj.tags?.join()],
  scoreFn: r => r.score * r.obj.bookmarked ? 2 : 1, // if the item is bookmarked, boost its score
})

var keysResult = results[0]
// When using multiple `keys`, results are different. They're indexable to get each normal result
keysResult[0].highlight() // 'Liechi <b>Berry</b>'
keysResult[1].highlight() // 'Raises <b>Attack</b> when HP is low.'
keysResult.score          // .84
keysResult.obj.title      // 'Liechi Berry'
```



## How To Go Fast · Performance Tips

```js
let targets = [{file: 'Monitor.cpp'}, {file: 'MeshRenderer.cpp'}]

// filter out targets that you don't need to search! especially long ones!
targets = targets.filter(t => t.file.length < 1000)

// if your targets don't change often, provide prepared targets instead of raw strings!
targets.forEach(t => t.filePrepared = fuzzysort.prepare(t.file))

// don't use options.key if you don't need a reference to your original obj
targets = targets.map(t => t.filePrepared)

const options = {
  limit: 100,    // don't return more results than you need!
  threshold: .5, // don't return bad results
}
fuzzysort.go('gotta', targets, options)
fuzzysort.go('go',    targets, options)
fuzzysort.go('fast',  targets, options)
```


### Gotcha
`result.score` is implemented as a getter/setter and stored different internally
`r.score = .3; // r.score == 0.30000000000000004`
